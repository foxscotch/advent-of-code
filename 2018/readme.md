These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

Days 1 and 2 were done with [@VoxLight](https://github.com/VoxLight), and we
should continue to finish up the rest of the challenges alongside each other. It
would definitely provide some much-needed motivation to not forget about it
after a week or two.
