These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).  
2015 is in Python (CPython 3.5.2), and 2016 will be in JavaScript (Node 7.0.0).

With December 2016 coming up, I'm getting ready for this year's event. Which
means, first of all, moving 2015's stuff to a folder named... 2015. As I'm sure
you can imagine, 2016's stuff is gonna be in a folder named 2016. Also, I'm
gonna try to get that finished up before December, but uh yeah we'll see.

Actually now it's December 2017 and I forgot about 2016 whoops. I think this
year I'll do the challenges in whatever language I feel like when I get started.
I'll list any version/library requirements in the source files, I guess.

My answer for each part is listed in the corresponding challenge file, but the
answers are not found in the source files (they were before). Because, according
to [someone](http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?action=profile;u=10721), the
answers might be the same. Only our answers for section 4 of 2015 match (so
far), but I just removed the answers from all source files anyway. This way,
someone could hypothetically look at them without having to worry about
accidentally spoiling an answer.
