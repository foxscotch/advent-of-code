These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/). 2015
is in Python (CPython 3.5.2), and 2016 will be in JavaScript (Node 7.0.0). The
rest are in pretty much whatever. Usually one of those two though.

~~With December 2016 coming up, I'm getting ready for this year's event.~~
~~Which means, first of all, moving 2015's stuff to a folder named... 2015. As~~
~~I'm sure you can imagine, 2016's stuff is gonna be in a folder named 2016.~~
~~Also, I'm gonna try to get that finished up before December, but uh yeah~~
~~we'll see.~~

~~Actually now it's December 2017 and I forgot about 2016 whoops. I think~~
~~this year I'll do the challenges in whatever language I feel like when I get~~
~~started. I'll list any version/library requirements in the source files, I~~
~~guess.~~

~~Whoops it's almost December 2018 and I still haven't finished any of the~~
~~previous years. Oh well. I'll probably do pretty much the exact same thing I~~
~~did for 2017.~~

~~Wow.......... yeah. 2020 now. This year I am aiming to do all of them as~~
~~they come. I'll also try to complete some from previous years that I didn't~~
~~get to. Might continue doing that after Christmas too. Maybe. No promises.~~

~~Uh oh 2021. Maybe I will get a better rate.~~

~~2022: We'll just have to see how it goes.~~

Okay so it's 2023 now and I'm gonna try but no promises.

My answer for each part is listed in the corresponding challenge file, but the
answers are not found in the source files. This way, someone could
hypothetically look at the solutions without having to worry about accidentally
spoiling an actual answer.
