These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).  
They're made for Python 3, but some of them _might_ work with Python 2 as well.

My answer for each part is listed in the corresponding challenge file, but the
answers are not found in the source files (they were before). Because, according
to [someone](http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?action=profile;u=10721), the
answers might be the same. Only our answers for section 4 match (so far), but I
just removed the answers from all source files anyway. This way, someone could
hypothetically look at them without having to worry about accidentally spoiling
an answer.
